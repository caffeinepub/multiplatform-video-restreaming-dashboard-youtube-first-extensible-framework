  "summary": "Diff implements major parts of requested Quick Start enhancements (fireplace title generator, previous value storage helpers, preset parsing utilities, Google Drive link detection/guidance), adds a new StreamHealthPanel and wires it into SessionDetailPage, and extends queries with output fetching hooks. Some acceptance criteria cannot be fully verified from the truncated diffs (notably persistence timing after a successful Quick Start start, and full UI copy/tip placement).",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-10",
      "requirement": "Save the last used session title and last used video source URL locally after a successful Quick Start start.",
      "reason": "Storage setter helpers are added and imported, but the truncated QuickStartDialog diff does not show any code that calls setLastUsedTitle/setLastUsedVideoUrl on successful Quick Start completion, so persistence-after-success is not verifiable from the provided diff.",
      "evidence": [
        "frontend/src/lib/quickStartStorage.ts",
        "frontend/src/components/QuickStartDialog.tsx (truncated; shows imports but not the success handler code)"
      ]

  "hallucinated_features": [
    {
      "description": "Added batch React Query hooks for fetching multiple outputs/layers (useGetOutputs, useGetLayers).",
      "reason": "BuildRequest only asks for Stream Health/Quick Start UX changes; it does not request new batch query hooks.",
